The capture of values in Swift's closure and OC's Block is different.

### <font size=3 color=#4169E1>**1. The capture of values in OC.**</font> 
```Swift 
NSInteger a = 100;
void(^block)(void) = ^{
    NSLog(@"block = %ld:", a);
};
 
a += 1;
NSLog(@"out1 = %ld:", a);
block();
NSLog(@"out2 = %ld:", a);
//result:
2021-08-17 11:27:13.846743+0800 MDProject[30746:23593763] out1 = 101
2021-08-17 11:27:13.846885+0800 MDProject[30746:23593763] block = 100
2021-08-17 11:27:13.847002+0800 MDProject[30746:23593763] out2 = 101
```
### <font size=3 color=#4169E1>**2. The capture of values in Swift.**</font> 
```Swift
var a = 100
let closure = {
    print("closure = \(a)")
}
a += 1
print("out 1 = \(a)")
closure()
print("out 2 = \(a)")
```
Result:
```Swift
out1 = 101
closure = 101
out 2 = 101
```
Swift closures capture "references", not the objects they reference. We can print the address of variable a to prove this.
```Swift
var a = 100
withUnsafePointer(to: &a) {ptr in print(ptr)}
let closure = {
    print("closure = \(a)")
    withUnsafePointer(to: &a) {ptr in print(ptr)}
}
closure()
a += 1
print("out 1 = \(a)")
withUnsafePointer(to: &a) {ptr in print(ptr)}

closure()
print("out 2 = \(a)")
withUnsafePointer(to: &a) {ptr in print(ptr)}
```
Result as follows:
```Swift
0x0000600000209490
closure = 100
0x0000600000209490
out 1 = 101
0x0000600000209490
closure = 101
0x0000600000209490
out 2 = 101
0x0000600000209490
```
They all have the same address, It proves that closure capture the reference of the variable, not like block in OC.

### <font size=3 color=#4169E1>**3. Modify value in closure.**</font>  
If we want to modity value in block, we should add "__block" or "__weak", that will make the block capture reference of variable from outside.
Let me see how closure handle this case.
```Swift
var a = 100
let closure = {
    a += 1
    print("closure = \(a)")
}
print("out 1 = \(a)")
closure()
print("out 2 = \(a)")
```
Result:
```Swift
out 1 = 100
closure = 101
out 2 = 101
```
We can modify the value of the variable in closure directly because closure capture the reference of the variable by default.

### <font size=3 color=#4169E1>**4. Capturing list in closure.**</font>   
If we capture variable in capturing list in closure, what will happen? Let me see that.
```Swift
var a = 100
let closure = {
    [a] in
    print("closure = \(a)")
}
a += 1
print("out 1 = \(a)")
closure()
print("out 2 = \(a)")
```
Result:
```Swift
out 1 = 101
closure = 100
out 2 = 101
```
At this time if we want to modify 'a' in closure:
```Swift
var a = 100
let closure = {
    [a] in
    a += 1
    print("closure = \(a)")
}
a += 1
print("out 1 = \(a)")
closure()
print("out 2 = \(a)")
```
It will get an error like that:

And this is a tip for us that variable 'a' is an immutable capture now.
